## Character Details for Asset Creation

### Maya Chen Quote:
"I need practical examples and quick feedback. Mobile learning works best for my schedule. Show me how to write briefs that actually persuade judges."

### Robert Martinez Quote:
"I don't have time for lengthy training, but I need my team writing better. Show me proven methods with real case examples that deliver results."
