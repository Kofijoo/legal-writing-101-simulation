## Scene 1 Scripts

### NARR_01_Sarah_Opening
**Duration:** 45 seconds
**Character:** Sarah Kim

"Welcome to JUS. I'm Sarah Kim, Learning Director. We have a challenge that needs your expertise.

Our Legal Writing 101 course isn't working. Look at these numbers - only 45% completion rate, and learners are telling us it's too theoretical.

Comments like 'I can't apply this to real cases' and 'feels outdated' are common. We need a complete redesign.

Your mission: transform this traditional course into a modern, blended learning experience that actually improves legal writing performance.

First, help me identify the core problems we need to solve."

**Duration:** 20 seconds
**Character:** Patricia Williams

"I'm Judge Williams. I've been on the federal bench for twenty years, and I see poorly written submissions daily. Legal writing must be clear, precise, and professional. Standards matter - this isn't creative writing. Lawyers must write clearly because lives and livelihoods depend on it."

### NARR_06_ALEX_Analysis
**Duration:** 45 seconds
**Character:** ALEX

"Interesting personas. Maya needs scaffolded practice with immediate feedback. Robert wants efficiency and proven ROI. Patricia demands professional rigor and accuracy.

### NARR_18_David_Stakeholder_Feedback
**Duration:** 35 seconds
