"I'm Robert, a litigation partner. I don't have time for lengthy training, but I need my team writing better. Show me proven methods with real case examples that deliver results."

### Patricia Williams (Video):
"I'm Judge Williams. I see poorly written submissions daily. Legal writing must be clear, precise, and professional. Standards matter - this isn't creative writing."

### ALEX Analysis:
"Interesting personas. Maya needs scaffolded practice, Robert wants efficiency and ROI, Patricia demands rigor. Your design choice here will shape everything - modality, content depth, assessment approach. Who's your primary focus?"
