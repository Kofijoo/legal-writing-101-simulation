## Script

### Sarah Kim (Final Narration):
"Congratulations! Your redesigned Legal Writing 101 has been approved for pilot implementation.

Let me summarize what you accomplished:
- Identified key performance gaps in traditional legal education
- Selected appropriate design frameworks for the legal context
- Created a blended learning solution addressing diverse learner needs
- Successfully incorporated stakeholder feedback
- Used data analytics to validate design decisions

Your course design projects 78% completion rates and 34% improvement in writing quality - exactly what we need.

You've demonstrated the core competencies of a learning designer: strategic thinking, stakeholder management, and learner-centered design."

### Achievement Summary Display:

## Variables Set:
- completion_status = true
- final_effectiveness_score = [calculated total]
- competency_demonstrated = true
- replay_interest = [selected option]
- resource_downloads = [array of selected resources]
- simulation_completion_time = [total elapsed time]

## Assessment Integration:
**Final Competency Check:** "What was the most critical factor in your design success?"
- A) Choosing the right technology platform
- B) Understanding learner needs first ✓

## Branching Logic:
### Replay Pathways:
- **Persona Replay:** Jumps to Scene 2, maintains other variables
- **Framework Replay:** Jumps to Scene 3, maintains persona choice
- **Modality Replay:** Jumps to Scene 4, maintains persona and framework
- **Full Replay:** Complete restart with knowledge retention

### Completion Tracking:
- First completion: Unlock all replay options
- Second completion: Unlock advanced scenarios
- Third completion: Unlock expert mode with additional constraints

## Success Metrics:
**Simulation Effectiveness:**
- Completion rate target: >85%
- Average effectiveness score: >75/100
- Stakeholder satisfaction: >80/100
- Replay engagement: >40%

## Transition Options:
**End Simulation:** Return to LMS/portfolio
**Replay:** Jump to selected scene with modified parameters
