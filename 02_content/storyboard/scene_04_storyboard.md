## Script

### ALEX Narration:
"Time to choose your delivery method for Legal Writing 101. Each option balances different priorities.

**Workshop + Pre-work** - Combines self-paced preparation with intensive live practice. High engagement, but requires scheduling coordination.

**Digital Microlearning** - Bite-sized modules learners complete at their own pace. Highly scalable and mobile-friendly, but less peer interaction.

**Hybrid Approach** - Best of both worlds. Digital case studies with live peer review sessions. Flexible but more complex to manage.

Use these sliders to explore the trade-offs. What matters most for your Legal Writing 101 redesign?"

## Interactions

### Impact Sliders (Range Controls):

**Slider 1: Time Investment vs. Learning Depth**

- Affects: Content complexity, assessment rigor

**Slider 2: Engagement vs. Resource Cost**
- Left (Low Cost): Automated content, minimal facilitation
- Right (High Engagement): Live instruction, personal feedback
- Affects: Budget requirements, staffing needs

**Slider 3: Scalability vs. Personalization**
- Left (High Scale): One-size-fits-all, automated delivery
- Right (High Personal): Customized paths, individual attention

### Real-time Feedback:
As sliders move, display updates:
- Projected completion rates
- Resource requirements
- Learner satisfaction estimates
- Implementation timeline

### Modality Recommendation:
Based on slider positions, ALEX suggests:
- High time + engagement + personalization → Workshop + Pre-work
- Low time + scalability focus → Digital Microlearning
- Balanced approach → Hybrid Method

## Variables Set:
- modality_choice = [workshop/digital/hybrid]
- time_investment = [slider value 1-10]
- engagement_priority = [slider value 1-10]
- scalability_need = [slider value 1-10]
- resource_budget = [calculated from sliders]
