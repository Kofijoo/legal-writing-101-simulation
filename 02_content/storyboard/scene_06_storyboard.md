## Script

### Sarah Kim (Learning Director):
"I like the blended approach, but I have concerns about scalability. We have 500+ lawyers across 12 offices. How will this design work for remote learners? And what's the total cost per learner? I need to justify this to the executive team with clear ROI metrics."

### David Thompson (Legal SME):
"The content looks engaging, but does it meet bar association continuing education requirements? I don't see enough emphasis on citation standards and professional writing conventions. Will learners actually produce better legal documents? We can't sacrifice accuracy for engagement."

### Lisa Park (Marketing):
"This fits our innovation brand perfectly, but how does it differentiate from competitors? Can we showcase the AI feedback feature in our marketing? Also, will this integrate with our existing JUS Academy platform? Brand consistency is crucial for market positioning."

## Interactions

### Stakeholder Concern Resolution:

**Sarah's Scalability Concern:**
Response Options:
- A) "We'll create recorded sessions for remote access" (+scalability)
- B) "Regional facilitators will ensure consistency" (+quality)
- C) "Hybrid model allows flexible participation" (+engagement)

**David's Standards Concern:**
Response Options:
- A) "Add dedicated citation workshop module" (+compliance)
- B) "Include bar association approved content" (+credibility)
- C) "Require SME review of all materials" (+accuracy)

**Lisa's Brand Concern:**
Response Options:
- A) "Highlight AI innovation in course marketing" (+differentiation)
- B) "Ensure seamless JUS Academy integration" (+consistency)
- C) "Create branded course completion certificates" (+value)

### Feedback Integration System:
Each response choice affects:
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Score** (0-100 per stakeholder)
- **Course Design Modifications** (components added/changed)
- **Implementation Complexity** (resource requirements)
- **Market Positioning** (competitive advantage)

### Dynamic Course Updates:
Based on responses, course builder shows:
- New components added (e.g., Citation Workshop)
- Modified delivery methods (e.g., Remote Access Options)
- Updated branding elements (e.g., JUS Academy Integration)

## Variables Set:
- sarah_satisfaction = [0-100 based on scalability response]
- david_satisfaction = [0-100 based on standards response]  
- lisa_satisfaction = [0-100 based on brand response]
- stakeholder_satisfaction = [average of all three]
- design_revisions = [array of changes made]
- implementation_complexity = [calculated from responses]
- compliance_level = [based on David's feedback integration]

## Scoring Logic:
**Optimal Responses (100% satisfaction):**
- Sarah: Option C (Hybrid flexibility)
- David: Option A (Citation workshop)
- Lisa: Option B (Platform integration)

**Suboptimal Responses (60-80% satisfaction):**
- Addresses concern but creates new challenges
- Partial solution requiring additional resources

**Poor Responses (20-40% satisfaction):**
- Doesn't address core concern
- Creates additional problems

## Assessment Integration:
**Reflection Question:** "How did stakeholder feedback change your design priorities?"
**Knowledge Check:** "Which stakeholder concern most impacts course credibility?"
- A) Scalability (Sarah)
- B) Professional standards (David) ✓
- C) Brand integration (Lisa)

## Transition:
"Great job addressing stakeholder concerns. Now let's see how your revised design performs with projected analytics."
