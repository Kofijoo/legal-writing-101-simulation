## Script

### ALEX Narration:
"Now choose your design framework. Each approach will shape how you redesign Legal Writing 101.

**ADDIE** - Systematic and thorough. You'll analyze current course gaps, design solutions methodically, develop with SME validation. Perfect for comprehensive overhauls.

**SAM** - Rapid and iterative. You'll create quick prototypes, test with learners, refine based on feedback. Ideal when you need fast results.

**Learning Experience Canvas** - Human-centered design. You'll map the learner journey, co-create with stakeholders, focus on experience over content. Best for engagement challenges.

Which framework matches your redesign approach?"

## Interactions

### Framework Selection (Single Choice):

**Option A: ADDIE**
- Preview: "Systematic 5-phase approach"
- Tools Unlocked: Gap analysis templates, design specifications
- Process: Linear with validation gates

**Option B: SAM**
- Preview: "Rapid prototyping cycles" 
- Tools Unlocked: Quick mockup tools, feedback loops
- Process: Iterative with fast testing

**Option C: Learning Experience Canvas**
- Preview: "Learner journey mapping"
- Tools Unlocked: Experience maps, co-creation workshops
- Process: Human-centered design thinking

### ALEX Follow-up:
Based on selection:
- **ADDIE:** "Excellent. We'll be thorough and systematic. Ready for detailed analysis?"
- **SAM:** "Smart choice. Speed and iteration. Ready to prototype quickly?"
- **LEC:** "Perfect. Learner experience first. Ready to map their journey?"

## Variables Set:
- design_framework = [ADDIE/SAM/LEC]
- methodology_focus = [systematic/iterative/experiential]
- tools_available = [based on framework choice]

## Branching Consequences:
- **ADDIE → Scene 4:** Shows structured modality options
- **SAM → Scene 4:** Emphasizes rapid testing capabilities  
- **LEC → Scene 4:** Focuses on learner experience design

## Transition:
"Great choice. Now let's decide how to deliver your redesigned Legal Writing 101 course."
