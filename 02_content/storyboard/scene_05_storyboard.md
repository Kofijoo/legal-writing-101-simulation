## Interactions

### Drag-and-Drop Course Builder:
**Component Library (Left Panel):**
- Video Case Studies (Engagement +15, Application +10)
- Interactive Exercises (Engagement +20, Learning +15)
- AI Writing Feedback (Learning +25, Application +20)
- Peer Review Sessions (Engagement +10, Application +15)
- Expert Lectures (Learning +10, Credibility +20)
- Practice Briefs (Application +25, Learning +10)

### Real-time Scoring System:
**Effectiveness Calculations:**
- Engagement = (Interactive components × 20) + (Live elements × 15)
- Learning = (Practice components × 25) + (Feedback elements × 20)
- Application = (Real-world elements × 30) + (Assessment × 15)

**Scoring Thresholds:**
- 0-60: "Needs improvement"
- 61-80: "Good foundation"  
- 81-100: "Excellent design"

### ALEX Dynamic Feedback:
**Missing Components:**

- No feedback: "Include feedback mechanisms"
- No assessment: "How will you measure success?"

**Sequencing Suggestions:**
- Practice before theory: "Consider flipping the sequence"
- Missing scaffolding: "Add foundational elements first"
- Overloaded weeks: "Balance the cognitive load"

## Variables Set:
- course_structure = [array of selected components]
- component_sequence = [ordered timeline]
- effectiveness_score = [calculated total]
- engagement_score = [calculated subtotal]
- learning_score = [calculated subtotal]
- application_score = [calculated subtotal]
- alex_suggestions_used = [count of implemented suggestions]
